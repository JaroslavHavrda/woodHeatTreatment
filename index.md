#Woodden horses
##Making of the horses
I started with timber blocks:

I used template to draw horses on blocks:

Using couping saw, hand saw and chisel I made the rough horses shape:

I cut corners of the horse by knife, rasp and sand paper:

Then I used some more sand paper, put lineseed oil on one of the horses and put into oven heated on 200Â°C. The result is:

##Weight versus time in oven
I did not measure times very precisely. So please take the following table with grain of salt.

|Time in oven|weight of raw horse|weight of lineseed oil treated horse|
|------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| start      | 139g              | 173g                               |
| 1h         | 124g              | 162g                               |
| 2h         | 121g              | 159g                               |
| 4h         | 116g              | 155g                               |
| 6h         | 112g              | 154g                               |

The weight on start was measured before the oil was applied.
